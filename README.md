# Marketing-Data-Analysis
This is a data analysis of a marketing dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data). The dataset is from a food delivery platform. It contains customer demographics (age, education, marital status etc.), number and amount of purchased made and the response of customers to each marketing campaign.

The data was cleaned since it was not a perfectly clean dataset. (There were null values, outliers and redundant variables, some data types were not correct.)

In the first part of the project, an Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) was done to provide insights into the dataset. Using bar chart, boxplot, heatmap and correlation coefficient, the distribution of the data and the relationship between variables were discovered.

In the second part, the following questions were answered using statistical analysis:

What factors are significantly related to the number of store purchases?
Does US fare significantly better than the Rest of the World in terms of total purchases?
Your supervisor insists that people who buy gold are more conservative. Therefore, people who spent an above average amount on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test
Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain. Accordingly, do "Married PhD candidates" have a significant relation with amount spent on fish? What other factors are significantly related to amount spent on fish? (Hint: use your knowledge of interaction variables/effects)
Is there a significant relationship between geographical regional and success of a campaign?
What does the average customer look like for this company?
